The project was done in a group of 3. We programed a circuit simulator similar to industry-available LTSpice that takes s input a netlist describing an electrical circuit and outputs the voltage and current flowing through each node. The program makes use of Modified Nodal Analysis for DC analysis and uses Newton's method with small-signal analysis to approximate the AC behaviour of non-linear components.
