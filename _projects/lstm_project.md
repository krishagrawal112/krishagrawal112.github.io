A LSTM was trained and evaluated on the [Zillow Home Value Index](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) dataset to predict future median house prices in California.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/rnn.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

The repository with the code can be found [here](https://github.com/krishagrawal112/Future-House-Price-LSTM). Note that the module was part of I-Explore which is a basic pass/fail module; therefore, the work was done in a sprint and can be improved a lot.
