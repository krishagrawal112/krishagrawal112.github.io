A U-net model was created in PyTorch for with the appropriate encoder and decoder paths. The model was trained and tested on a brain tumour detection dataset. The project involved visualising the dataset, implementing a class and member functions to load data for training/testing, building the U-net architecture and deploying it on the test set.
