The project was done in a group of 4. It involved programming a musical synthesiser. The keyboard controlled using a ST NUCLEO-L432KC microcontroller module that contains a STM32L432KCU6U processor, which has an Arm Cortex-M4 core. The aim was to provide users with common synthesiser feastures as well as the ability to combine multiple keyboards togeth with different octaves.

My contribution was in the signal processing/generation part where I implemented sound features like different waveform sounds, low-frequency osccilation (vibrato and tremolo) and ADSR.
