The project, done in a group of 4, composed of 2 parts. The first part involved creating a Python library that implements, trains, and evaluates a fully-connected feedforward neural network from scratch. The second part involved training, hyperparameter-tuning, and evaluating a neural network on a regression task, namely predicting house prices in the famous California House Prices dataset.

The code for the project can be found [here]().
