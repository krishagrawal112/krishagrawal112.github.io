I am a 3rd year MEng Electronic and Information Engineering (Computer Engineering) student at Imperial College London graduating in 2024, and I will be attending ETH Zurich as an exchange student for my final year. I am currently undertaking a 6-month undergraduate research placement with the Circuits and Systems group at my university where I am working on extending and further accelerating [fpgaConvNet](https://cas.ee.ic.ac.uk/people/sv1310/fpgaConvNet.html), a software toolchain for mapping/accelerating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) onto FPGAs.

My interests lie in machine learning, digital hardware, and the interface between them. There is a need to bridge the growing gap between state-of-the-art machine learning models and the computational capablities of our hardware; I would like to play my role in doing so from both the algorithmic and digital design perspectives.
