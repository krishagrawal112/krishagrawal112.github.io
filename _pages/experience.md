#### Circuits and Systems, Imperial College London (Mar 2023 - Sep 2023)

##### *Undergraduate Researcher*
- Undertaking a 6-month Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP) supervised by Dr. Christos Bouganis to work on extending fpgaConvNet, a software toolchain for mapping and accelerating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) onto FPGAs.
- Projects
  - **Inducing Activation Sparsity**: Investigating ways to fine-tune pretrained CNNs in PyTorch for inducing more activation map sparsity in a hardware-aware manner.
  - **Dynamic Scheduling**: Exploring new ways to dynamically skip zero-input Multiply-Accumulate operations in hardware (Chisel) to speed up computation.
  - **Hardware modelling**: Extending and improving the performance and resource modelling of the tool for more optimal hardware designs.

#### Arm Ltd. (Jul 2022 - Sep 2022)

##### *Hardware Engineering Intern*
- Interned for 12 weeks in the Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) team of the Systems IP division in Cambridge, United Kingdom.
- Projects
  - **Requirement Tracing Testing**: Converted the existing requirement-tracing test infrastructure from Shell scripts to a standardized and scalable form using Pytest, a software testing framework for Python.
  - **Functional Coverage for a Component**: Implemented functional coverage in SystemVerilog for the testbench of a block in an upcoming release at the time.
